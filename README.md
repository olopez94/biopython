# Biopython-Tutorial
The Biopython Project is an international association of developers of freely available Python tools for computational molecular biology.

## A brief introduction into [Biopython](https://biopython.org/)
 Python is an object 
oriented, interpreted, flexible language that is becoming increasingly 
popular for scientific computing. Python is easy to learn, has a very 
clear syntax and can easily be extended with modules written in C, C++ 
or FORTRAN.

The Biopython web site (http://www.biopython.org) provides
an online resource for modules, scripts, and web links for developers
of Python-based software for bioinformatics use and research. Basically,
the goal of Biopython is to make it as easy as possible to use Python
for bioinformatics.
